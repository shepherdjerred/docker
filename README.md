This repository contains resources related to my home server, currently called
`turing`. I give each of my servers a unique name so that I can keep track of
them over time.

Currently my server is managed with Kubernetes. I've used Docker, Ansible, and
bash scripts in the past. Kubernetes has been an interesting experiment and I
think it's overall worthwhile since the ecosystem is so rich.

## Installation

These instructions are for future me, so that I can re-create my cluster from
scratch if needed.

Host Setup:

- Install Tailscale
- Install Linuxbrew
- Install fish, vim, helix, rtx, languages, etc.
- Setup auto-updates with Ubuntu

  - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates

Cluster Setup:

1. Install k3s.

   ```
   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
   ```

   - Configure:

     ```
     rm -rfv ~/.kube && mkdir ~/.kube && sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config && sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.kube/config && chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
     ```

1. Install `helm` and `argocd`.

   ```
   brew install helm argocd
   ```

1. Install argocd.

   ```
   kubectl create namespace argocd
   kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
   ```

1. Port-forward argocd to access the UI.

   ```
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443 --address 0.0.0.0
   ```

1. Get the initial Argo CD `admin` password.

   ```
   argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
   ```

1. Go to the Argo CD UI at `http://<host>:8080`. Change the `admin` password.

1. Add `apps/` directory in this repository to argocd.
1. Sync the `apps` Application.
1. Create the `1password` namespace.

   ```
   kubectl create namespace 1password
   ```

1. Set the credentials in the `manual` directory. Create these resources using
   `kubectl apply`.

   - Be sure not to commit any changes to these files so that secrets don't
     leak.
   - These should be the only credentials that are manually set. Everything else
     can be retrieved from 1Password.
   - Annoyingly, the credential in `1password-secret.yaml` _must_ be base64
     encoded.

     ```
     cat 1password-credentials.json | base64 -w 0
     ```

1. Sync the 1Password application.
1. Sync all of the applications.
1. Install Nvidia Drivers for Plex GPU acceleration.

   - Follow these instructions:

     - https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html
     - https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html

   - Note: it seems that the k8s operator is _not_ required for things to work
     properly.

1. Install Hauppauge Drivers for Hauppauge TV tuners.

   - https://www.hauppauge.com/pages/support/support_linux.html

1. Setup encryption at rest.

   - https://docs.k3s.io/security/secrets-encryption

1. Follow the K3s hardening guide.

   - https://docs.k3s.io/security/hardening-guide

1. Increase number of file watchers
